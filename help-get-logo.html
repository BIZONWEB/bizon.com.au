If you google "business logo" then you can find a bunch of websites which provides you a service for making a new logo. For example,
<a href="https://www.freelogoservices.com/" target="_blank">freelogoservices</a> shows you lots of logo examples and lets you select a logo which fit your business the best.
You can also customize your logo by editing the business name, color, and font. It is actually not a free service because it will eventually charge you 39.95 AUD.
But it is not too bad. You can find other websites which provide similar services.
